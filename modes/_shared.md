# System Context -- career-ops

<!-- ============================================================
     THIS FILE IS AUTO-UPDATABLE. Don't put personal data here.
     
     Your customizations go in modes/_profile.md (never auto-updated).
     This file contains system rules, scoring logic, and tool config
     that improve with each career-ops release.
     ============================================================ -->

## Sources of Truth

| File | Path | When |
|------|------|------|
| cv.md | `cv.md` (project root) | ALWAYS |
| article-digest.md | `article-digest.md` (if exists) | ALWAYS (detailed proof points) |
| profile.yml | `config/profile.yml` | ALWAYS (candidate identity and targets) |
| _profile.md | `modes/_profile.md` | ALWAYS (user archetypes, narrative, negotiation) |

**RULE: NEVER hardcode metrics from proof points.** Read them from cv.md + article-digest.md at evaluation time.
**RULE: For article/project metrics, article-digest.md takes precedence over cv.md.**
**RULE: Read _profile.md AFTER this file. User customizations in _profile.md override defaults here.**

## Scoring System

The evaluation uses 6 blocks (A–F) with a global score of 1–5:

| Dimension | What it measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Academic Fit | GPA, test scores, and research background vs program requirements |
| Research / Career Fit | Alignment of research interests with faculty directions and program goals |
| Funding | Quality of funding package (fellowship/RA/TA), net annual cost vs profile ceiling |
| Program Quality | Ranking context, faculty strength, alumni outcomes, program reputation |
| Red Flags | Visa complications, accreditation issues, unrealistic deadline, outlier acceptance rate |
| **Global** | Weighted average of above |

**Score interpretation:**
- 4.5+ → Strong fit, apply now
- 4.0–4.4 → Good fit, worth applying
- 3.5–3.9 → Borderline; apply only if specific reason
- Below 3.5 → Recommend against (see Ethical Use in CLAUDE.md)

## Program Type Detection

Classify every program into one of these types (or hybrid of 2):

| Program Type | Key signals on program page |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| Research-track MS | Thesis requirement, advisor assignment, lab rotations, faculty research pages prominent |
| Professional MS | Coursework-heavy, capstone project, career placement stats, industry partnerships |
| Interdisciplinary MS | Cross-department faculty, applied problem framing, non-standard degree title |
| Conversion degree | "No prior CS required", bridging coursework, designed for career switchers |
| Part-time / Online MS | Async options, cohort flexibility, working-professional focus |

After detecting program type, read `modes/_profile.md` framing table for the
user's specific framing and proof points for that program type.

## Global Rules

### NEVER

1. Invent experience or metrics
2. Modify cv.md or portfolio files
3. Submit applications on behalf of the candidate
4. Share phone number in generated messages
5. Recommend comp below market rate
6. Generate a PDF without reading the JD first
7. Use corporate-speak
8. Ignore the tracker (every evaluated offer gets registered)

### ALWAYS

0. **Cover letter:** If the form allows it, ALWAYS include one. Same visual design as CV. JD quotes mapped to proof points. 1 page max.
1. Read cv.md, _profile.md, and article-digest.md (if exists) before evaluating
1b. **First evaluation of each session:** Run `node cv-sync-check.mjs`. If warnings, notify user.
2. Detect the role archetype and adapt framing per _profile.md
3. Cite exact lines from CV when matching
4. Use WebSearch for comp and company data
5. Register in tracker after evaluating
6. Generate content in the language of the JD (EN default)
7. Be direct and actionable -- no fluff
8. Native tech English for generated text. Short sentences, action verbs, no passive voice.
8b. Case study URLs in PDF Professional Summary (recruiter may only read this).
9. **Tracker additions as TSV** -- NEVER edit applications.md directly. Write TSV in `batch/tracker-additions/`.
10. **Include `**URL:**` in every report header.**

### Tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| WebSearch | Comp research, trends, company culture, LinkedIn contacts, fallback for JDs |
| WebFetch | Fallback for extracting JDs from static pages |
| Playwright | Verify offers (browser_navigate + browser_snapshot). **NEVER 2+ agents with Playwright in parallel.** |
| Read | cv.md, _profile.md, article-digest.md, cv-template.html |
| Write | Temporary HTML for PDF, applications.md, reports .md |
| Edit | Update tracker |
| Canva MCP | Optional visual CV generation. Duplicate base design, edit text, export PDF. Requires `canva_resume_design_id` in profile.yml. |
| Bash | `node generate-pdf.mjs` |

### Time-to-offer priority
- Working demo + metrics > perfection
- Apply sooner > learn more
- 80/20 approach, timebox everything

## Professional Writing & ATS Compatibility

These rules apply to ALL generated text that ends up in candidate-facing documents: PDF summaries, bullets, cover letters, form answers, LinkedIn messages. They do NOT apply to internal evaluation reports.

### Avoid cliché phrases
- "passionate about" / "results-oriented" / "proven track record"
- "leveraged" (use "used" or name the tool)
- "spearheaded" (use "led" or "ran")
- "facilitated" (use "ran" or "set up")
- "synergies" / "robust" / "seamless" / "cutting-edge" / "innovative"
- "in today's fast-paced world"
- "demonstrated ability to" / "best practices" (name the practice)

### Unicode normalization for ATS
`generate-pdf.mjs` automatically normalizes em-dashes, smart quotes, and zero-width characters to ASCII equivalents for maximum ATS compatibility. But avoid generating them in the first place.

### Vary sentence structure
- Don't start every bullet with the same verb
- Mix sentence lengths (short. Then longer with context. Short again.)
- Don't always use "X, Y, and Z" — sometimes two items, sometimes four

### Prefer specifics over abstractions
- "Cut p95 latency from 2.1s to 380ms" beats "improved performance"
- "Postgres + pgvector for retrieval over 12k docs" beats "designed scalable RAG architecture"
- Name tools, projects, and customers when allowed
